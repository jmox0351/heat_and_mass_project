The function named centralDifCoef below will output the coefients for a central finite difference approximation for an given derivative, and order of convergence. The 3 point method listed in the problem statement has a second order of convergence, but as we will show in the experimental design discussion this is likely insuffient for the radial approximation which means our bottleneck for accuracy can likely be improved by using more points for our radial approximations.

    "https://www.adafruit.com/product/372\n",
    "The key point here is that it is completely realistic to expect sample sizes on the order of $O(10^{-6})-O(10^{-4})$ seconds depending on the clock rate of our controller and with a bit of smoothing we can expect good accuracy. With some work we can probably get this at least a couple of orders of magnitude lower, because most wire formats are capable of transmitting at least 1Mbit/s which means getting a 16 bit sample in under 0.1ms should be no problem as a default. If we want 1Gbit/s we can likely use a LAN hookup and then translate the wire format in the controller which would give us 16 bits in under $0.1 \\mu s$. We can look at I2C data transfer rates and see that we will not be bottlenecked by our wire format for this type of application. This means we can expect the number of significant digits in the temperature readings to come from the resistor. To gather experimental data to see if our readings are correct the best way I can think of right now is to take a paddle bit and drill out the center of the carrot and then stick our thermocouple to the inside of the cylinder. This means that our experimental data will be constrained by the accuracy of the calaper that we use to measure the thickness of the carrot, and how many different sized paddle bits we can find. We are going to be lucky if we can get millimeter precison here, likely we will have $O(10^{-3})-O(10^{-2})$ meter precision here. Using our current methods with a 2 point forward difference approximation for time and a 3 point central difference method for radius we can see that the error is bounded above by $O(\\Delta t) + O(\\Delta r^2)$ which means that we expect that it will be easier to design this experiment in a way where the error from the radial term dominates. This is easy to remidy by using a higher order central difference method for the interior points such as a 5 point method which will result in 4th order convergence. At any level of desired accuracy we should probably use a finite difference method with 3 time faster convergence for the radial term vs. the time term."
